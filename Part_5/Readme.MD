Communications Fundamentals

Networks can vary in size and complexity. It is not enough to have a connection, devices must agree on “how” to communicate.

There are three elements to any communication:
- There will be a source (sender).
- There will be a destination (receiver).
- There will be a channel (media) that provides for the path of communications to occur.

Communications Protocols
- All communications are governed by protocols.
- Protocols are the rules that communications will follow.
- These rules will vary depending on the protocol.


**********

Rule Establishment 

Protocols must account for the following requirements:
- An identified sender and receiver
- Common language and grammar
- Speed and timing of delivery
- Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements


**********

Network Protocol Requirements

Common computer protocols must be in agreement and include the following requirements: 
- Message encoding
- Message formatting and encapsulation
- Message size
- Message timing
- Message delivery options

Message Encoding
- Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form for transmission. 
- Decoding reverses this process to interpret the information.

Message Formatting and Encapsulation
- When a message is sent, it must use a specific format or structure. 
- Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.

Message Size

Encoding between hosts must be in an appropriate format for the medium.
- Messages sent across the network are converted to bits
- The bits are encoded into a pattern of light, sound, or electrical impulses.
- The destination host must decode the signals to interpret the message.
