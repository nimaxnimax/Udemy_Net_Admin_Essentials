Communications Fundamentals

Networks can vary in size and complexity. It is not enough to have a connection, devices must agree on “how” to communicate.

There are three elements to any communication:
- There will be a source (sender).
- There will be a destination (receiver).
- There will be a channel (media) that provides for the path of communications to occur.

Communications Protocols
- All communications are governed by protocols.
- Protocols are the rules that communications will follow.
- These rules will vary depending on the protocol.
