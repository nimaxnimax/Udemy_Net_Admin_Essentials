Network Protocol

Network protocols define a common set of rules.

Can be implemented on devices in:

Software

Hardware

Both

Protocols have their own:

Function

Format

Rules

Network Protocol Functions

Devices use agreed-upon protocols to communicate.

Protocols may have may have one or functions.

Protocol Interaction

Networks require the use of several protocols.

Each protocol has its own function and format.

Network Protocol Suites

Protocols must be able to work with other protocols.

Protocol suite:

A group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function

Sets of rules that work together to help solve a problem

The protocols are viewed in terms of layers:

Higher Layers

Lower Layers- concerned with moving data and provide services to upper layers

Evolution of Protocol Suites

There are several protocol suites.

Internet Protocol Suite or TCP/IP- The most common protocol suite and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols- Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)

AppleTalk- Proprietary suite release by Apple Inc.

Novell NetWare- Proprietary suite developed by Novell Inc.

TCP/IP Protocol Example

TCP/IP protocols operate at the application, transport, and internet layers.

The most common network access layer LAN protocols are Ethernet and WLAN (wireless LAN).

TCP/IP Protocol Suite

TCP/IP is the protocol suite used by the internet and includes many protocols.

TCP/IP is:

An open standard protocol suite that is freely available to the public and can be used by any vendor

A standards-based protocol suite that is endorsed by the networking industry and approved by a standards organization to ensure interoperability
